        How We Collect and Use Personal and Anonymous Data
      </h3>
      <p className="section__description">
        When you access the Site, register for any associated products and/or
        services, or opt-in to receive newsletters and other communications from
        us, we may collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you. We may
        also collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data when you send us
        information or communications. “Personal Data” means data that allows
        someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, and without
        limitation, your name, phone number, physical address, Internet Protocol
        (IP) address, and email address when you access the Site or any
        associated products and/or services. “Anonymous Data” refers to data
        about you that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data.
        Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons.
        To make the Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by
        a third-party service provider) may collect Personal Data or Anonymous
        Data from you such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol
        (IP) address, domain name, Site usage and statistics, and/or a date/time
        stamp of your visit to the Site. We may also use cookies and
        navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and referring
        URLs to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit. We
        may also use Personal Data and Anonymous Data for market research
        purposes and to improve our services and the Site. We may share
        Anonymous Data with selected third parties and business partners,
        however, we will not share any Anonymous Data if such information is,
        contains, or will be linked to your Personal Data, unless we have given
        you notice, as described in this Privacy Policy, and you have given us
        authorization to do so. Assembly will use Personal Data and IP addresses
        to identify users of the Site if and when we feel it is necessary to
        enforce compliance with the Site’s policies or to protect our services,
        the Site, or other users of the Site and/or services.
      </p>
      <h3 className="section__title text-2xl">Security of Data</h3>
      <p className="section__description">
        Assembly is committed to protecting the security of any Personal Data
        that is collected by Assembly. We use a variety of industry-standard
        security technologies and procedures to help protect any Personal Data
        from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Despite these measures, no
        method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
        storage is 100% secure. Assembly cannot fully eliminate security risks
        associated with the collection and storage of any Personal Data,
        including without limitation, any mistakes and security breaches that
        may happen. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
        protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        In the unlikely event of a data breach where your Personal Data has been
        compromised, Assembly will promptly notify you, the applicable
        authorities and supervisory authorities or data protection authorities.
        If you are located in the EU/EEA and Assembly is required to transfer
        your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we exert
        commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any transfer of your
        Personal Data outside of the EU/EEA is protected under industry-standard
        contractual clauses and any subsequent data protection safeguards.
